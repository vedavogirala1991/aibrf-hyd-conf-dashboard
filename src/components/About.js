              The first convention of the bank retirees all over India was held at Ahmadabad
              on 30 th April, 1994.The hall was full of delegates from all over the country.
              The convention was unique in many respects due to the presence of senior citizens
              of the country and culminated with grand success. A large number of serving and
              retied bank employees participated including the representatives of AIBEA, AIBOC,
              AIBOA and LIC.</p>
              <p className='pp-intro'>
              Shri R.C.Chakraborty, founder General Secretary of AIBEA, AIBOA and President of
              AICBOO was elected to preside over the Delegates session.</p>
              <p className='pp-intro'>
              Padmshree Shree Arvindbhai Buch, a veteran Gandhian Labor leader of International
              fame inaugurated the function. He inspired the members to go ahead in order to raise
              our voice with courage and conviction to ventilate the grievances of old retirees from
              messenger to managers. He extended his ashirwad for the success of the all India
              convention of bank retirees to secure old age benefits like pension , medical aid etc.</p>
              <p className='pp-intro'>
              Mr.B.P.Bajpai, Jt. Convenor gave an introduction relating to the efforts made by the
              apex body of All Bank Retirees for over a decade. He said this convention is the result
              of last thirteen years efforts. It is most unfortunate that all those in authority are
              still to realize that a pension scheme is an essential security measure for the senior
              citizens of the country. How the members of Parliament enjoy pension without providing
              social justice for teeming millions of the country?</p>
              <p className='pp-intro'>
              Pension Agreement between IBA and different bank employees’ organizations with cutoff
              date as 1.1.1986 is against the norms of social justice and arbitrary. Those who served
              the industry with a meager amount shedding their sweat and blood for the development of
              the banking industry left out from the purview of the pension scheme. Old age benefits like
              pension, Medical Aid etc. are the prime necessity.</p>
              <p className='pp-intro'>
              There is no provision of medical Aids for the bank retirees, which is a must without delay.</p>

              and to secure rightful claim of old age benefits like pension for all without discrimination
              and medical aids. Most of the unions of working class employees can do many things to help
              the retirees in every manner at their own initiative.</p>

              <p className='pp-intro'>

              <p className='pp-intro'>
              Only one united organization is the need of the hour for bank retirees.
              United struggle shall deliver the goods. This formation of Apex body for bank retirees
              will go ahead a long way in the history.</p>
              <p className='pp-intro'>
              Mr.T.M.Mathews,Genral Secretary , Kerala Retired Bank Employees Federation stressed
              the need of such an Apex body of bank retirees for the common cause of bank retirees.</p>
              <p className='pp-intro'>
              All bank retirees should work together. Although the IBA has ignored us but this is
              an opportune moment to raise our voice that everybody will hear, hence it is the need of the
              hour to stand by the All India Bank Retirees Federation as a rock like solidarity.
              Bank retirees have no class. We are one solid rock from messengers to managers.
              That is the only solution to solve our problems.</p>
